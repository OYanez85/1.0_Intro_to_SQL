###Â´Dates
# There are two ways that dates can be stored in BigQuery: as a DATE or as a DATETIME.
---------------
# The DATE format has the year first, then the month, and then the day. It looks like this:

YYYY-[M]M-[D]D

# The DATETIME format is like the date format ... but with time added at the end.
---------------
### EXTRACT
# Often you'll want to look at part of a date, like the year or the day. You can do this with EXTRACT. 

query = """
      SELECT Name, EXTRACT(DAY from Date) AS Day
      FROM 'bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets_with_date'

query = """
      SELECT Name, EXTRACT(DAY from Date) AS Week
      FROM 'bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets_with_date'
